Symfony CLI Edition
========================

Welcome to the Symfony CLI Edition - a fully-functional Symfony2
application that you can use as the skeleton for your new commandline applications.

This document contains information on how to download, install, and start
using Symfony. For a more detailed explanation, see the [Installation][1]
chapter of the Symfony Documentation.

1) Installing the CLI Edition
----------------------------------

When it comes to installing the Symfony CLI Edition, you have the
following options.

### Use Composer (*recommended*)

As Symfony uses [Composer][2] to manage its dependencies, the recommended way
to create a new project is to use it.

If you don't have Composer yet, download it following the instructions on
http://getcomposer.org/ or just run the following command:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Then, use the `create-project` command to generate a new Symfony application:

    php composer.phar create-project geekchimp/symfony-cli-edition path/to/install

Composer will install Symfony and all its dependencies under the
`path/to/install` directory.

### Download an Archive File

To quickly test Symfony, you can also download an [archive][3] of the Standard
Edition and unpack it somewhere under your web server root directory.

If you downloaded an archive "without vendors", you also need to install all
the necessary dependencies. Download composer (see above) and run the
following command:

    php composer.phar install

2) Checking your System Configuration
-------------------------------------

Before starting coding, make sure that your local system is properly
configured for Symfony.

Execute the `check.php` script from the command line:

    php app/check.php

If you get any warnings or recommendations, fix them before moving on.

3) Running the Demo Application
--------------------------------

Congratulations! You're now ready to use Symfony for your CLI applications.

To see a real-live Symfony CLI script, run the following scipt:

    php app/console demo:greet GeekChimp

4) Getting started with Symfony
-------------------------------

This distribution is meant to be the starting point for your Symfony
CLI applications, but it also contains some sample code that you can learn from
and play with.

A great way to start learning Symfony is via the [Quick Tour][4], which will
take you through all the basic features of Symfony2.

Once you're feeling good, you can move onto reading the official
[Symfony2 book][5].

A default bundle, `AcmeDemoBundle`, shows you Symfony2 in action. After
playing with it, you can remove it by following these steps:

  * delete the `src/Acme` directory;

  * remove the AcmeBundle from the registered bundles in `app/AppKernel.php`;

What's inside?
---------------

The Symfony Standard Edition is configured with the following defaults:

  * Doctrine ORM/DBAL is configured;

  * Swiftmailer is configured;

  * Annotations for everything are enabled.

It comes pre-configured with the following bundles:

  * **FrameworkBundle** - The core Symfony framework bundle

  * [**SensioFrameworkExtraBundle**][6] - Adds several enhancements.

  * [**DoctrineBundle**][7] - Adds support for the Doctrine ORM

  * [**SwiftmailerBundle**][10] - Adds support for Swiftmailer, a library for
    sending emails

  * [**MonologBundle**][11] - Adds support for Monolog, a logging library

  * [**AsseticBundle**][12] - Adds support for Assetic, an asset processing
    library

  * **SensioDistributionBundle** (in dev/test env) - Adds functionality for
    configuring and working with Symfony distributions

  * [**SensioGeneratorBundle**][13] (in dev/test env) - Adds code generation
    capabilities

  * **AcmeDemoBundle** (in dev/test env) - A demo bundle with some example
    code

Enjoy!
